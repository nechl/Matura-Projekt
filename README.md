# Matura Project 2021

## KochBot

This is a final project of two students of the KSBA Baden which will be graded and fully counted in the final certificate.

We try to create a cookbot based on a raspberry pi, with which we, in the end, can cook pasta remotly.

You can order pasta via an UI based on Flask. The reason why we picked Flask is that it is an extension to Python, which will fit perfectly with our instructions for the hardware via raspberry, which will be written in Python too.

There is the functionality to edit orders on the fly, so that you don't have to tweak the database itself.
